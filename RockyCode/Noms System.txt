Step 5: +nom System
I suggest doing this next since we are going to be making it per character. The character-based set up will aid us in converting everything to an account-wide system later on. To recap, the +nom System is the ability for players to vote, once per week, for a character who has shown phenomenal RP. We were thinking 3-5 +noms per person, assuming per account. I suggest that how many +noms a person has to give be shown in +account and how many they've earned be shown in +xp. We also discussed a leaderboard where the top earners could be shown each week. We'll need to make a board for this (I don't want it going on Announcements since we compel people to read stuff on that board with annoying reminders). It should show, perhaps, only the top 5 for now. 

Need new board for +noms stuff but will need a fn`bbpost

Step 6: Account-wide XP
The next step should be making XP account-wide. +noms should still be calculating on each character, but then that total XP should go into an account-wide pool. I can't recall if XP is given out once a day or once a week, but that will likely need to be taken into account. When it comes to NPCs, the XP they earn should go onto their Account, but not XP given for purchasing stuff. At about the same time, all purchasing code needs to be adjusted to buy from the account-wide XP pool. Mission code will also need to be adjusted.
